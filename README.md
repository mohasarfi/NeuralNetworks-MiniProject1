# NeuralNetworks-MiniProject1
First mini project of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course instructed by Dr.Kalhor,School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran\
Following Topics have been covered in this project\
* CNN for image classification\
  A convlutional neural network is developed fo the purpose of image classification. To reach this goal convultional layers have been used for feature extraction along with Batch-Normalizaton and Drop out layers in order to prevent overfitting. CIFAR10 dataset is used for this question \
  The final best accuracy on the test dataset is : 0.874
* Paper review :
