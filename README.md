# NeuralNetworks-MiniProject1
First mini project of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course instructed by Dr.Kalhor,School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran\
Following Topics have been covered in this project\
* Question1 : CNN for image classification\
  A convolutional  neural network is developed for the purpose of image classification. To reach this goal convolutional layers have been used for feature extraction along with Batch-Normalization and Drop out layers in order to prevent overfitting. CIFAR10 dataset is used for this question \
  The final best accuracy on the test dataset is : 0.874
* Question 2 : a review on the Inception Network + Transfer learning  
  First of all, Inception Deep neural network and its variations have been studied completely. In the next step, Transfer learning technique has been used to classify images not presented in the train or test dataset. Picture of an acoustic guitar was taken and network was successful  to predict it correctly (with 95.8% accuracy)
* Question 3 : YOLO-V5\
  First YOLO network architecture was studied.Then YOLO-V5 was trained on the chess pieces provided by RoboFlow. Result was satisfying and pieces were detected and labeled correctly in most cases.\
